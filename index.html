    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a computational physicist with the Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT. My primary research interests center around the use of numerical simulations and probabilistic algorithms for inference, data analysis, and inverse problems. Much of my recent work has been focused on nuclear security&mdash;including assessing the accuracy of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), simulating reentry vehicles, and characterizing the performance of inertial and satellite-based guidance and navigation systems. I have also worked on a range of other topics over the years, all through the lens of computational modeling and Bayesian data analysis, including self-interacting dark matter, the growth and movement of ancient human populations, and the reliability of renewable electricity generation in Europe.</p>
    <p>I grew up just outside of Palmer, Alaska, and I now divide my time between Cambridge, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington. When not working I can often be found trail running, climbing, or skiing uphill in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, or New Hampshire.</p>

    <h3>Why does this webpage look like this?</h3>
    <p>While I formerly designed this page with Jekyll, I found most web development engines and templates unintuitive and constraining. While I know nothing about web development, I've decided to use this page as an opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, and whatever other acronyms inevitably come up. I guess you could also say that I'm inspired by the olden days of static sites and raw HTML. This is a work in progress, and additional content is forthcoming. In the meantime, please accept my apology for the overall appearance of this page. </p>
